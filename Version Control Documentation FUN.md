<summary><h2>ðŸ”€ Detailed Branching Strategy</h2></summary>

Hereâ€™s a clear guide to understanding our branching strategy. This section outlines the different types of branches we use and how they work together.

## 1.1 Branch Types

### Branch Types Overview

**Understanding Our Branches:**

- **ðŸ“¦ Master/Main Branch:**
  - **Purpose:** This is our stable branch, containing production-ready code. All code thatâ€™s deployed to clients is merged into this branch.
  - **Versioning:** Follows Semantic Versioning (SEMVER): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
    - **MAJOR:** For breaking changes.
    - **MINOR:** For new features that are backward-compatible.
    - **PATCH:** For minor bug fixes.
  - **Update Rules:** 
    - **MAJOR Changes:** Increase the MAJOR version.
    - **MINOR Changes:** Increase the MINOR version.
    - **PATCH Fixes:** Increase the PATCH version.

- **ðŸš€ Develop Branch:**
  - **Purpose:** This branch serves as the integration point for new features and bug fixes before they are merged into `master/main`.
  - **Versioning:** Uses the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-dev-FEATURE.BUG.ITERATION`.
    - **dev:** Indicates the development stage.
    - **FEATURE, BUG, ITERATION:** Tracks the progress of development.
  - **Update Rules:** 
    - **FEATURE Increment:** When a new feature branch is merged.
    - **BUG Increment:** When a bug fix branch is merged.
    - **ITERATION Increment:** For each development iteration or change.

- **ðŸ”¨ Feature/Bug Branches:**
  - **Purpose:** These branches are used to develop new features or fix bugs. They are created from the `develop` branch and are intended to keep the main codebase stable.
  - **Naming Convention:**
    - Feature branches: `feature/feature-name-vX.Y.Z`
    - Bug branches: `bug/bug-description-vX.Y.Z`
  - **Update Rules:** 
    - **Versioning:** These branches inherit their version from the `develop` branch but do not have their own version numbers.

- **ðŸš‘ Hotfix Branches:**
  - **Purpose:** These branches are used for urgent fixes to issues in the production environment. They are created directly from `master/main` and are intended to address critical problems that need immediate resolution.
  - **Naming Convention:** `hotfix/hotfix-description-vX.Y.Z`
  - **Update Rules:** 
    - **Versioning:** These branches follow the same versioning rules as bug branches, inheriting from the current version of `master/main`.
  
### Example Branch Structure

Hereâ€™s an example of how our branches might evolve:

```plaintext
master/main -> 2.0.0
      |
      v
develop -> 2.0.0-dev-0.0.0
      |
      v
feature/login-screen-v2.0.0
bug/fix-login-error-v2.0.0
      |
      v
develop -> 2.0.0-dev-1.1.0
      |
      v
hotfix/fix-payment-gateway-v2.0.0
      |
      v
master/main -> 2.0.1
      |
      v
develop -> 2.0.1-dev-1.1.0
```
- **Starting Point:** `master/main` at version `2.0.0`.
- **Development Stage:** `develop` at `2.0.0-dev-0.0.0`, with feature and bug branches.
- **Updates:** `develop` progresses to `2.0.0-dev-1.1.0` as changes are integrated.
- **Hotfix:** `hotfix/fix-payment-gateway-v2.0.0` is created to address a critical issue and is merged back into `master/main` as `2.0.1`.
- **Final State:** `master/main` is updated to `2.0.1`, and `develop` is aligned to `2.0.1-dev-1.1.0` for further development.
This structure ensures smooth integration of new features, bug fixes, and urgent hotfixes, leading to stable releases and timely resolution of critical issues.

<summary><h2>ðŸ“¦ Document for Master/Main </h2></summary>

This section outlines how we manage versioning and updates for our `master/main` branch. Understanding these guidelines helps ensure that our releases are consistent and well-documented.

## 2.1 Versioning Scheme

### Versioning Scheme for `master/main`

- **Semantic Versioning (SEMVER):** We use the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for our releases.
  - **MAJOR:** Represents significant changes that break backward compatibility.
  - **MINOR:** Indicates backward-compatible new features or enhancements.
  - **PATCH:** Denotes small bug fixes or minor improvements that are backward-compatible.

## 2.2 Rules for Versioning

### Versioning Rules

**How to Increment Versions:**

- **MAJOR Version Increment:**
  - Triggered by breaking changes or major updates.
  - **Example:** Updating from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0` might involve a complete redesign of the application.

- **MINOR Version Increment:**
  - Applied when new features are added that do not break backward compatibility.
  - **Example:** Moving from `2.0.0` to `2.1.0` could introduce new functionality such as a new payment gateway.

- **PATCH Version Increment:**
  - Used for backward-compatible bug fixes or minor tweaks.
  - **Example:** Changing from `2.1.0` to `2.1.1` may fix a minor issue like a small UI glitch.

## 2.3 Examples

### Versioning Examples

**Hereâ€™s how different versions look:**

- **Version 1.0.0:** The initial release featuring core functionalities.
- **Version 1.1.0:** Introduced additional reporting features.
- **Version 1.1.1:** Addressed minor bugs related to user settings.
- **Version 2.0.0:** Marked a major overhaul of the user interface and core features.

These examples illustrate how our version numbers reflect the nature and scale of changes in each release.

<summary><h2>ðŸš€ Document for Develop</h2></summary>

This section covers how we handle versioning and updates for the `develop` branch. Itâ€™s essential for keeping track of ongoing development and ensuring a smooth transition to the `master/main` branch.

## 3.1 Versioning Scheme

### Versioning Scheme for `develop`

- **Version Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-dev-FEATURE.BUG.ITERATION`
  - **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:** Reflects the base version of the `master/main` branch.
  - **dev:** Indicates that this version is in development.
  - **FEATURE:** Tracks the number of feature branches merged.
  - **BUG:** Tracks the number of bug branches merged.
  - **ITERATION:** Shows individual development iterations or changes.

## 3.2 Rules for Versioning

### Versioning Rules

**Guidelines for Versioning in `develop`:**

- **Maintain Alignment with Master/Main:**
  - Ensure the `develop` branch version aligns with the `master/main` version, with an additional suffix to indicate development status.
  - **Example:** If `master/main` is at `2.0.2`, `develop` might start as `2.0.2-dev-0.0.0`.

- **Version Increment Rules:**
  - **FEATURE:** Increment this number each time a feature branch is merged into `develop`.
    - **Example:** `2.0.2-dev-1.0.0` shows 1 feature branch merged.
  - **BUG:** Increment this number for each bug branch merged.
    - **Example:** `2.0.2-dev-1.1.0` reflects 1 feature branch and 1 bug fix merged.
  - **ITERATION:** Increment this for each new iteration or change during development.
    - **Example:** `2.0.2-dev-1.1.1` indicates 1 feature, 1 bug fix, and 1 iteration.

## 3.3 Examples

<details>
<summary><h2>ðŸš‘ Document for Hotfix Branches</h2></summary>

This section covers how we handle versioning and updates for hotfix branches. Hotfix branches are used for urgent fixes to issues in the production environment and are merged directly into the `master/main` branch.

## 5.1 Versioning Scheme

### Versioning Scheme for Hotfix Branches

- **Version Format:** `hotfix/hotfix-description-vX.Y.Z`
- **hotfix:** Indicates an urgent fix applied to production.
- **hotfix-description:** A brief description of the hotfix.
- **vX.Y.Z:** The version of the `master/main` branch being fixed.

## 5.2 Rules for Versioning

### Versioning Rules

**Guidelines for Hotfix Branches:**

- **Creating a Hotfix Branch:**
  - Hotfix branches are created directly from the `master/main` branch to address critical issues.
    - **Example:** `hotfix/urgent-security-fix-v2.0.1` indicates a critical security issue that affects version `2.0.1`.

- **Merging Hotfix Branches:**
  - Once the hotfix is completed and tested, merge the hotfix branch directly into `master/main` and also sync `master/main` into develop to keep the development branch up-to-date.
    - **Example:** After merging `hotfix/urgent-security-fix-v2.0.1` into `master/main`, update `master/main` to `2.0.2`, and then sync `main/master 2.0.2` into `develop`.

- **Version Increment Rules:**
  - **PATCH Increment:** Hotfix branches usually result in an increment of the PATCH version on the `master/main` branch.
    - **Example:** Merging `hotfix/urgent-security-fix-v2.0.1` results in `master/main` version `2.0.2`.

## 5.3 Examples

### Hotfix Examples

**Hereâ€™s how hotfix branches might be used:**

- **Hotfix Branch Example:** `hotfix/critical-bug-v2.1.0`
  - **Purpose:** Fixing a critical bug in version `2.1.0` of `master/main`.
  - **Outcome:** `master/main` is updated to `2.1.1` after the hotfix is applied.

- **Hotfix Branch Example:** `hotfix/security-patch-v2.0.2`
  - **Purpose:** Applying a security patch to version `2.0.2` of `master/main`.
  - **Outcome:** `master/main` is updated to `2.0.3` after the hotfix is applied.

These examples illustrate how hotfix branches are used to quickly address urgent issues and how they affect versioning.

## 5.1 Workflow

### Workflow Overview

**Steps for Managing Your Code:**

- **Create Branches:**
  - **Feature Branches:** Created from the `develop` branch for new features.
  - **Bug Branches:** Created from the `develop` branch for bug fixes.
  - **Naming Convention:** Include the version of the `master/main` branch the branch targets (e.g., `feature/new-dashboard-v2.0.2`).

- **Develop Code:**
  - Work on the feature or bug fix in the respective branch.
  - Ensure adherence to coding guidelines and perform thorough testing.

- **Merge to Develop:**
  - After successful testing, merge the feature or bug branch into the `develop` branch.
  - Make sure `develop` reflects these changes by updating the version as needed.

- **Test Develop Branch:**
  - Conduct comprehensive testing on the `develop` branch.
  - Update the version of `develop` using the `FEATURE.BUG.ITERATION` suffix to reflect progress.

- **Merge to Master/Main:**
  - Once the `develop` branch is stable and ready for production, merge it into `master/main`.
  - Increment the `master/main` version according to the changes made (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH).

- **Tag and Release:**
  - Tag the release on the `master/main` branch with the updated version number.
  - Create detailed release notes including changes, compatibility, and deployment information.

## 5.2 Versioning and Version Control Handling

### Versioning and Control Guidelines

**Managing Versions and Releases:**

- **Feature and Bug Fixes:**
  - Ensure the version number of feature and bug branches aligns with the `master/main` version they target.
    - **Example:** If `master/main` is at `2.0.2`, a feature branch should be named `feature/feature-name-v2.0.2`.

- **Develop Branch Versions:**
  - The `develop` branch should include an additional suffix to indicate its development status (e.g., `2.0.2-dev-1.1.1`).
  - Update the `develop` version as new features or bug fixes are integrated, reflecting the current state of development.

- **Release Management:**
  - Each release from `master/main` should be tagged and documented comprehensively.
  - Maintain a clear history of changes and version increments to facilitate potential rollbacks.

## Example Workflow

### Workflow Examples

**Hereâ€™s how you might follow the workflow:**

- **Create Feature Branch:**
  - **Branch Name:** `feature/new-dashboard-v2.0.2`
  - **Description:** Develop a new dashboard feature for `master/main` version `2.0.2`.

- **Merge Feature Branch:**
  - After merging `feature/new-dashboard-v2.0.2` into `develop`, update `develop` to `2.0.2-dev-1.0.0` if this is the first feature branch merged.

- **Prepare for Release:**
  - Ensure `develop` is stable and incorporates all planned features and fixes.

- **Merge into Master/Main:**
  - **Tag Version:** `v2.1.0` if significant new features were included.
