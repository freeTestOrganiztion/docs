Here’s a clear guide to understanding our branching strategy. This section outlines the different types of branches we use and how they work together.

## 1.1 Branch Types

### Branch Types Overview

**Understanding Our Branches:**

- **📦 Master/Main Branch:**
  - **Purpose:** This is our stable branch, containing production-ready code. All code that’s deployed to clients is merged into this branch.
  - **Versioning:** Follows Semantic Versioning (SEMVER): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
    - **MAJOR:** For breaking changes.
    - **MINOR:** For new features that are backward-compatible.
    - **PATCH:** For minor bug fixes.
  - **Update Rules:** 
    - **MAJOR Changes:** Increase the MAJOR version.
    - **MINOR Changes:** Increase the MINOR version.
    - **PATCH Fixes:** Increase the PATCH version.

- **🚀 Develop Branch:**
  - **Purpose:** This branch serves as the integration point for new features and bug fixes before they are merged into `master/main`.
  - **Versioning:** Uses the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-dev-FEATURE.BUG.ITERATION`.
    - **dev:** Indicates the development stage.
    - **FEATURE, BUG, ITERATION:** Tracks the progress of development.
  - **Update Rules:** 
    - **FEATURE Increment:** When a new feature branch is merged.
    - **BUG Increment:** When a bug fix branch is merged.
    - **ITERATION Increment:** For each development iteration or change.

- **🔨 Feature/Bug Branches:**
  - **Purpose:** These branches are used to develop new features or fix bugs. They are created from the `develop` branch and are intended to keep the main codebase stable.
  - **Naming Convention:**
    - Feature branches: `feature/feature-name-vX.Y.Z`
    - Bug branches: `bug/bug-description-vX.Y.Z`
  - **Update Rules:** 
    - **Versioning:** These branches inherit their version from the `develop` branch but do not have their own version numbers.

### Example Branch Structure

Here’s an example of how our branches might evolve:

```plaintext
master/main -> 2.0.0
      |
      v
develop -> 2.0.0-dev-0.0.0
      |
      v
feature/login-screen-v2.0.0
bug/fix-login-error-v2.0.0
      |
      v
develop -> 2.0.0-dev-1.1.0
      |
      v
master/main -> 2.1.0
```
- **Starting Point:** `master/main` at version `2.0.0`.
- **Development Stage:** `develop` at `2.0.0-dev-0.0.0`, with feature and bug branches.
- **Updates:** `develop` progresses to `2.0.0-dev-1.1.0` as changes are integrated, and `master/main` is updated to `2.1.0`.
This structure ensures smooth integration of new features and bug fixes, leading to stable releases.
